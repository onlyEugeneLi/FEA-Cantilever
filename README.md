# Finite Element Analysis for A Cantilever Beam

The goal of this assignment lies in the determination of the **correlation between the numbers of elements, namely the seeds global size, and the quality of FEA simulations**, regarding the precision of maximum stresses and deflections on the y axis. 

A comparison between the **theoretical stress calculations** and the **computer-based results** will be conducted. In the end, the optimal solution will be applied to analyse a new loading condition on the same cantilever beam.
